***PROBLEM***
- Create a game where the player thinks of a number between 1 and 1024
and the computer guesses it. 

***EXAMPLE***
My guess is 1. Is your number HIGHER, LOWER, or am I CORRECT? HIGHER

Ok, higher.

My guess is 2. Is your number HIGHER, LOWER, or am I CORRECT? HIGHER

Ok, higher.

My guess is 3. Is your number HIGHER, LOWER, or am I CORRECT? CORRECT

***DATA STRUCTURES***
`string`
`loop`
`int`
`boolean`

***ALGORITHM***
1. Display greeting to the user:
   a. "I am the magical number guesser. Think of a number 
       between 1 and 1024 and I will guess your number. Are you ready to play?"
2. Ask user to think of a number between 1 and 1024
   a. "Think of a number between 1 and 1024"
3. Guess the median number between 1 and 1024: 512. 
4. Ask user if their number is higher, lower, or correct. 
   a. if higher, guess median of number guessed (512) and the highest number (1024)
      1. (512 + 1024) / 2 = median number and new guess.
   b. if lower, guess median of number guessed and lowest number (1)
      1. 512 / 2 = median number and new guess
   c. if correct, display end of game message:
      1. "I told you I'd guess your number! "
5. Repeat step 4, until 4c occurs.
